ToDo App

## Description

This Web-App is created as a project given by #Coding Ninja. This project is to manage user's ToDo List, one can add a ToDo, update a ToDo if it was completed, and one can delete a perticular ToDo from database if needed.
To perform API calls I've used axios lib. #You can install axios in project with npm i axios command.
I have added FontAwsomeIcon to get the required icons for my project. #This can be included in the project with npm i --save @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core
npm install --save @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
npm install --save @fortawesome/react-fontaweso commands.
